Creating this project, let me learn how to:

- Properly manage Folders and File structure and hooks and refs.
- Manage the entire application using React Context API Next.js. 
- I learned File-based routing, Data fetching that allows server-side rendering and static generation which makes websites incredibly optimized (show getServerSideProps, getStaticPaths, getStaticProps), also I learned how to use Next.js as a backend endpoint.
- Learned how to integrate Stripe to manage payments, products, shipping rates, and the entire checkout process
- Learn how to manage the entire content using Sanity as a backend point.
